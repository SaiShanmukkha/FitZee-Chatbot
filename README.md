2. **Extract Flutter:**
   - Extract the downloaded zip file to a location of your choice (e.g., `C:\src\flutter` for Windows).

3. **Add Flutter to PATH:**
   - Update your system's environment variables:
     - On **Windows**: Add `flutter/bin` to the PATH variable.
     - On **macOS/Linux**: Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
       bash
       export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
       

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Run the following command in a terminal:
     bash
     flutter doctor

     - **API 33 (Android 13)**

4. **Create an Android Emulator:**
   - Go to **Tools > Device Manager** and create a new virtual device.
   - Select a hardware profile (e.g., Pixel 8).
   - Choose **API 33** as the system image.
   - Finish the setup and launch the emulator.

## Step 3: Set Up Flutter Toolchain

1. Run the following command to accept the Android licenses:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   ```

## Step 4: Create and Run a Flutter App

1. **Create a New Flutter Project:**
   - Run the following command:
     bash
     flutter create my_app
     
   - Replace `my_app` with your desired project name.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd my_app
   ```

3. **Run the App:**
   - Launch your Android emulator.
   - Run the following command to start the app:

## Step 5: Build an Android APK

1. **Prepare Your Project for Release:**
   - Open `android/app/build.gradle` and set the `minSdkVersion` to at least `21`.

2. **Generate the APK:**
   - Run the following command to build the release APK:
     bash
     flutter build apk --release
     
   - The APK will be located at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

3. **Install APK on Device:**
   - Transfer the APK to your Android device and install it.

## Common Issues and Fixes

1. **Flutter Not Recognized:**
   - Ensure Flutter is added to your system PATH correctly.

2. **Emulator Not Detected:**
   - Verify the emulator is running and that Android Studio SDK paths are configured.

3. **Build Fails:**
   - Run the following command to clean the build directory:
     bash
     flutter clean
     
   - Then rebuild:
     bash
     flutter build apk --release
